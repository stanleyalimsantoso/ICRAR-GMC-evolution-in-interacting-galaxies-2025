# ICRAR-GMC-evolution-in-interacting-galaxies-2025
This repository contains results and selected sample codes I developed to investigate the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in interacting and merging galaxy simulations

This is part of a research project I've been working on since April 2025, supervised by A/Prof Kenji Bekki at the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research(ICRAR). The full title is "Formation and evolution of massive stars and giant molecular clouds (GMCs)Â in interacting and merging galaxies"

## What I'm doing
The simulations were written by Kenji and run using the OzSTAR supercomputer. My job is to run different setups of the simulation(like isolated galaxies vs interacting galaxies) and analyse how things like tidal forces and collisions affect the formation of GMCs. To explain more, GMCs form when HI(atomic hydrogen) gas clumps at a localised space and gets dense enough to convert to H2(molecular hydrogen). GMCs are the birthplace of stars, as clouds of H2 gas contract and heat up, forming protostars and eventually becoming stars after achieving hydrogen burning in their core. When galaxies interact or collide, they generate tidal forces, which stretch and distort the structure of the galaxies, potentially helping or hindering the formation of GMCs.

First, let's do an isolated galaxy run and see how H2 gas and new stars evolve normally. Running Kenji's simulation gives 6 snapshots of how the galaxy looks at different intervals over 1.4 Gyr(that's 1.4 billion years!)
